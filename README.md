OracleServer.py starts the server on localhost:8080/

test\_oracle.py and test\_server.py test the system and the server respectively.
Note that for test\_vef\_spa.py to work, the server needs to be connectable to on http://localhost:8080/

It was designed in firefox, and it might be that not all the features work in other browsers, so please try with the latest firefox. Also, the sklearn needs to be version 0.13.1 or later.

Internal documentation might not be complete, and some might be in Icelandic. I'm only throwing this out there so that others creatign a website in python might use the base.

Uses data from baseketball-reference.com. Might not work after the 2013 NBA season.
